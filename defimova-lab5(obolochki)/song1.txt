[Verse 1]
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

[Verse 2]
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

[Chorus]
I wanna use you and abuse you
I wanna know what's inside you

[Interlude]
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on

[Bridge]
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

[Chorus]
I'm gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside...
Gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside you
